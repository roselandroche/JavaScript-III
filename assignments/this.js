/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. If you don't intentionally bind 'this' to a thing, it will automatically be tied to the global window/console.
* 2. When using dot notation, 'this' refers to the object to the left of the dot.
* 3. When using 'this' with a constructor, it refers to the specific iteration you just made (as opposed to the one it inherits stuff from)
* 4. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above

// Principle 1

// Whoops forgot to tie the code to a thing...
// console.log(this);

// Principle 2

// code example for Implicit Binding
// anObj ... ... ...
//          ... ... this.name ... ... 
// 'this' refers to anObj
